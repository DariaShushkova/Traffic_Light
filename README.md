# Traffic and Pedestrian Light System Repository

This repository contains the project related to traffic and pedestrian light system using Arduino. The repository is organized into folders with detailed documentation and implementation guidelines.

## Project Structure

1. The Traffic Light System
- Folder: CarTrafficLight/
- Description: Simulates a basic traffic light system on Arduino.
- [Detailed Documentation](lab/DariaShushkova/CarTrafficLight/)

2. Integrated Traffic and Pedestrian Light System
- Folder: PedestrianTrafficLight/
- Description: Extends the basic traffic light system to include pedestrian lights and the pedastrian button. Simulates a synchronized traffic and pedestrian lights on Arduino.
- [Detailed Documentation](lab/DariaShushkova/PedestrianTrafficLight/)

3. Realization of Traffic and Pedestrian Light System with real Adruino
- Folder: /lab/DariaShushkova/RealArduinoImplemetation/
- Description: Demonstrates a physical implementation of the traffic and pedestrian light systems using a real Arduino hardware and components.
